        <h2>Design Practices Needing Improvement</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Navigation: From the description, it's not clear how the navigation is structured. For best practices, main navigation links should be clearly and consistently labeled, and there should be aids like a site map or breadcrumbs.</li>
            <li>The use of images, especially with appropriate alt text, can enhance user experience</li>
            <li>Contact Information: While there's an address provided, it would be a good practice to also include a phone number, email address, and possibly a contact form for reservations or inquiries.</li>
        </ol>
